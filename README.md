# BE-177A-qDESS-Segmentation

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important non-invasive technique used for imaging soft tissue
and diagnosis of various diseases. Clinical diagnoses are mostly based on relative signal intensity
differences between different regions and tissue types. In recent years, there are emerging quantitative
MRI techniques that offer quantitative measurements of several physical or biochemical parameters in
spatially resolved maps, which are well suited for diagnosis, longitudinal studies, or monitoring of disease
progression. However, measuring quantitative values in specific tissue regions through manual
annotations can be laborious and difficult to achieve in routine clinical workflows. Deep learning methods
to automatically segment and detect different pathological conditions can assist MRI analysis and
interpretation. In this project, we will focus on a quantitative knee MRI technique, the quantitative 3D
dual-echo steady state (qDESS) sequence, that has been used to quantify tissue T2 relaxation time, a
parameter sensitive to cartilage degeneration. The objective of this project is to develop deep
learning methods to automatically segment various tissue types and detect pathology in knee
qDESS MRI.
